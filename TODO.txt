Likes:
    static type checking for view props
    "transpile time" error handling
    html/template mistakes throw meaningful errors instead of fail silently

Dislikes:
    hard to debug!
    fails silently or with wierd errors
    "sock drawer" type file structure
    components rely on inheritance but there's no indication in the architecture
